Life Span
Life Span is a web application that helps users visualize key milestones in their life on a timeline. Users can input dates such as their date of birth, the start of their first job, the beginning of their sexual life, and when they started driving. The app calculates and displays the duration of these events and logs the user's IP address and entered dates.
